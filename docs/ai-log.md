# AI log

Every time you give an AI tool a significant prompt, add an entry. Three lines each.
"Nothing was wrong" is allowed, but it is rarely true. Your instructor will read this.

## Build 2

### Prompt 1: Build 2 prompt (docs/build-2.md)
- **What I asked:**
- **What came back:**
- **What was wrong (or "nothing"):**

### Prompt 2:

## Build 3

### Prompt 1: Build 3 prompt (docs/build-3.md)
- **What I asked:** Add the architecture diagrams, booking state machine, Node HTTP router/server, configuration, startup script, and tests.
- **What came back:** A layered architecture document, explicit booking transitions, static-file HTTP server, `/health` route, startup configuration, and `node:test` coverage.
- **What was wrong (or "nothing"):** The first server draft relied on an implicit response/request property for HEAD handling and had redundant error-status logic; both were simplified. Added a regression test proving static requests cannot escape `public/`.

## Build 4

### Prompt 1: Build 4 prompt (docs/build-4.md)
- **What I asked:** The Build 4 prompt: an in-memory repository, event and booking services, a mock payment gateway, the API routes, `docs/api-examples.md` and API tests that start the real server.
- **What came back:** `src/repositories/memory.js`, `src/services/eventService.js`, `src/services/bookingService.js`, `src/lib/mockPaymentGateway.js`, `src/http/routes.js`, wiring in `src/server.js`, an error-code-to-status map in `src/http/app.js`, `docs/api-examples.md` and `test/api.test.js`.
- **What was wrong (or "nothing"):** In the Build 3 code, every DomainError came back as 400, so `SOLD_OUT` and `NOT_FOUND` would have had the wrong status; added one code-to-status map in `app.js`. The validation helpers lived privately inside `inventory.js`, so reusing them meant moving them to `src/domain/validation.js` rather than copying. Known gap left on purpose: two bookings at the same moment can both take the last seat (Build 5). *(My own review: add what you find when you read the code.)*
- **Rules I was unsure about:** whether `venue` is required (kept optional, as in Build 2); whether a stranger paying someone else's booking should get 403 or 404 (chose 403 `FORBIDDEN`); added `unpublish`, `GET /api/events/:id` and `GET /api/bookings/:reference`, which the prompt did not list but S04 and the curl examples need.
